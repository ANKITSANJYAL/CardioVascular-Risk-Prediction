# CardioVascular-Risk-Prediction
Cardio Vascular Risk Prediction and Lifestyle Recommendation

### 📌 Problem Statement
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally. Early prediction and personalized lifestyle guidance can significantly reduce the risk of CVDs. This project aims to develop a hybrid machine learning system that predicts cardiovascular risk and suggests daily lifestyle interventions to improve heart health.

### 🎯 Goals
- Predict cardiovascular risk using clinical and lifestyle data
- Compare classical ML and deep learning models
- Provide explainability using SHAP or LIME
- Build a Streamlit-based app for users to get risk scores + recommendations

### 🧠 Tech Stack
- **Data Source**: UCI Heart Disease Dataset, Synthetic Lifestyle Data
- **Languages**: Python
- **ML Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, TabNet/MLP
- **Explainability**: SHAP, LIME
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Deployment**: Streamlit, GitHub Pages
